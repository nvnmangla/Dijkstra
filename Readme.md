## Description
- Check the feasibility of all inputs/outputs (if user gives start and goal nodes that are in the obstacle
space they should be informed by a message and they should try again).
- Implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find a path between start and end point on a given map for a
point robot (radius = 0; clearance = 5 mm).
- The code outputs an animation of optimal path generation between start and goal point on
the map. It shows both the node exploration as well as the optimal path generated.
